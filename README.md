# Dominion
My Implementation of Dominion

# Overview
Dominion is a (brilliant) deck building card game.  

The goal of the game is to maximize your Victory Points.  You play by using your deck - which includes **Money Cards**, **Action Cards**, and **Victory Point Cards**.  The general strategy is to first make your deck *efficient* by purchasing lots of Money and Actions, then when the game nears the conclusion you use your efficient deck to buy as many Victory Points as Possible

New Players tend to *vastly* overestimate the power of different types of flashy **Action Cards** and overlook the humble but effective **Money Cards**.  

I wanted to simulate the power of **Money Card** focused strategies, so I implemented a simple version of Dominion 

# Results
Money-only strategies are much more powerful than people realize!  And can very easily end the game around turn 17-18.  Purchasing a couple of **Action Cards** can improve that a little, but buying too many **Action Cards** very quickly ruins the strategy!
